I havent made the grouping struct as I am sceptical about its necessity. If it comes to bite me 
in the ass, will add it.

Also, I will allow "abc"+123

I will also allow truthey and falsey values like in Python, it cuts down on functions
like isEmpty(), reducing bloat. This will mean that things such as !str are to be allowed.

We will have, for a bool literal, Literal b, the property b.t.token_val.i=1 and b.val.i=1 if 
true and 0 if not. The lType is LIT_NONE. 

For all literals, we maintain that the token_val of the token inside it matches the val field
of the literal.
