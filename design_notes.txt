I havent made the grouping struct as I am sceptical about its necessity. If it comes to bite me 
in the ass, will add it.

Also, I will allow "abc"+123

I will also allow truthey and falsey values like in Python, it cuts down on functions
like isEmpty(), reducing bloat. This will mean that things such as !str are to be allowed.

We will have, for a bool literal, Literal b, the property b.t.token_val.i=1 and b.val.i=1 if 
true and 0 if not. The lType is LIT_NONE. 

For all literals, we maintain that the token_val of the token inside it matches the val field
of the literal.


Truthiness:
To change the truthiness of something, it is enough to change the boolify() function in Eval/lib.c 

I will have variables initialized to nil if not assigned yet.
Also, there is a mild issue with overflows, but I don't really want to refactor all that code,
so I will simply document that any work will have to be done within the bounds of INT_MIN to INT_MAX
if integer. I can optionally provide a bigints library once I am done with classes.
