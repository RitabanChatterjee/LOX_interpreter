I havent made the grouping struct as I am sceptical about its necessity. If it comes to bite me 
in the ass, will add it.

Also, I will allow "abc"+123

I will also allow truthey and falsey values like in Python, it cuts down on functions
like isEmpty(), reducing bloat. This will mean that things such as !str are to be allowed
